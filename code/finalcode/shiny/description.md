#### Killed by Police - Description and Data Sources

The primary inspiration of this app is [The Guardian's The Counted Project](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database). 
The goal of the project is to build a **more comprehensive record of people killed by police in the United States** using their own sources and crowd-sourcing.

My goal in this inspired project was twofold. 

1. Learn how to gather and integrate data from multiple sources, then build an `R shiny` app to interactively explore that data using JavaScript-based tools such as `leaflet` and `ggvis`.
2. Combine The Counted data with state statistics on population demographics, violence, and police employment to understand potential relationships between these variables and identify state outliers.

The statistical analysis is still on-going, but this shiny app provides an opportunity for interactive, exploratory analysis.

Feel free to download the data, add-to it and conduct your own analyses. But please credit the data sources and aggregator:
