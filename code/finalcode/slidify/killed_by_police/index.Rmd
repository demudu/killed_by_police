## Background

In response to the string of highly publicized police killings of African Americans in the United States, <b>The Guardian</b> initiated a project to build a more comprehensive record of people killed by police in the United States. This project, [The Counted](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database), provides a very interesting data set to expand upon for further investigation on a very timely topic - police brutality in the United States.

## The Data

The primary data of interest is <b>Rate of People Killed by Police by Population</b>. As this plot shows, <b>Wyoming, New Mexico & Oklahoma</b> are distinct outliers. Further analysis could identify what confounding variables might be common to these states explaining the higher rate. This plot is rendered in `ggplot2`. I ran into too much difficulty getting `ggvis` to work in `slidify`, unfortunately.

```{r ggvisdata,echo=FALSE,cache=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10,fig.align='center'}
require(ggplot2)

thecounted_and_crime <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitjosh1050/killed_by_police/master/code/finalcode/shiny/data/thecounted_and_crime.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

ggplot(thecounted_and_crime,aes(x=killedbypolice2015_per100k,y=reorder(state,killedbypolice2015_per100k))) +
    geom_segment(aes(yend = state), size=1,xend = 0, colour ="#D2D2F0",guide=FALSE) +
    geom_point(aes(size=killedbypolice2015)) +
    scale_colour_brewer(palette ="Set1", guide = FALSE) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +
    ggtitle("Rate of People Killed by Police in the U.S. in 2015 by State") +
    labs(x = "Killed per 100k Population",y = "State", size="Number Killed\nby Police") +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = grid::unit(c(-1, 0), "points")))
```

## The App - Front Page

The app is published and available on [Shiny Apps](https://josh-morel.shinyapps.io/killed_by_police/), consisting of three tabs. The front page and first tab hosts an interactive `ggvis` dot-plot of <b>People Killed by Police</b> by state. The interactive features include:

<div style='text-align: center;'><img width="60%" alt="Killed by Police Dot-plot" src="assets/img/dotplot_demo.png"/></div>

## The App - Leaflet Map & Downloadable files

The second tab provides an interactive leaflet map. Clicking on the data-point displays a pop-up, which links back to the specific The Counted database entry. 

The third and final tab provides downloadable state-level data and the code book. 

<div style='text-align: center;'><img width="80%" alt="Killed by Police Leaflet" src="assets/img/leaflet_demo.png"/></div>
