The Counted is a data set collected, hosted and presented by [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/about-the-counted).

In this data products project, I am aim to enrich this data with other geographic data to see if we can gain deeper insights into which the places people kill police in the U.S.


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
